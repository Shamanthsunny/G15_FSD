        <p>Shiva, (Sanskrit: “Auspicious One”) also spelled Śiwa or Śiva, one of the 
        main deities of Hinduism, whom Shaivites worship as the supreme god. 
        Among his common epithets are Shambhu (“Benign”), Shankara (“Beneficent”), 
        Mahesha (“Great Lord”), and Mahadeva (“Great God”).
        Shiva is represented in a variety of forms: in a pacific mood with his 
        consort Parvati and son Skanda, as the cosmic dancer (Nataraja), 
        as a naked ascetic, as a mendicant beggar, as a yogi, as a Dalit 
        (formerly called untouchable) accompanied by a dog (Bhairava), and as the 
        androgynous union of Shiva and his consort in one body, half-male and half-female
         (Ardhanarishvara). He is both the great ascetic and the master of fertility, 
         and he is the master of both poison and medicine, through his ambivalent power over snakes.
          As Lord of Cattle (Pashupata), he is the benevolent herdsman—or, at times,
           the merciless slaughterer of the “beasts” that are the human souls in his care. 
           Although some of the combinations of roles may be explained by Shiva’s identification
            with earlier mythological figures, they arise primarily from a tendency in Hinduism 
            to see complementary qualities in a single ambiguous figure.</p>
